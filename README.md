We organize the repository in some projects, are they:

* **Simple implementation**
	* The simple implementation It consists in the most [basic example](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator#quick-start) suggested on documentation of [Nuvigator](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator).
* **Simple nuroute implementation**
	* The simple nuroute implementation It consists in the most [basic complete example](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator#quick-start) suggested on documentation of [Nuvigator](https://github.com/nubank/nuvigator). Basically this is a personalization of the route using instances of `NuRoute` and `Nurouter`.
* **Simple route parameters implementation**
	* The simple implementation of passing parameters by route consists of the multiple ways of passing parameters between application screens that nuvigator provides.
* **Nested nuvigators**
	* The nested nuvigators (nested nuvigators) implementation details how to create multiple streams in the application and link them together so that a modular design can have its navigation flow concentrated in each module but communicating with the entire application.
